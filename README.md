# Biomed-Lava
Minecraft datapack that changes the lava in the nether to corrispond with its biomes


This is my first datapack, I use SO much code from other creators so don't sleep on them!

 This pack works best in smaller areas with lava. Lava lakes do not work well in this pack.
 Set lighting to moody, and particles up for good atmosphere.
 
 To spead up or change settings go to \biomedlava_v1.0.0\data\spicykai\functions\config\default.mcfunction
 Mileage may vary, but more powerful computers will be able to push how far this pack can go.
